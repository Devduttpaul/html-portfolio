<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<P>"Oppenheimer" is a breathtaking masterpiece that skillfully combines the elements of action, audio, acting, direction, and scene design into an unforgettable cinematic experience. Directed by the visionary filmmaker, Christopher Nolan, the movie takes audiences on an electrifying journey that weaves together heart-pounding action sequences, immersive audio design, exceptional performances, stunning visuals, and meticulous direction. This review delves into the movie's prowess in each of these crucial areas, showcasing how it harmoniously creates a symphony of emotions and adrenaline.</P>

<h3>Transformers: The Last Knight</h3>
<p>After finally seeing this movie for the first time in a long time I completely love all that I saw, the characters, the effects, the musical score, the story, the feelings, the intensity, the action, the mystery, everything about this movie intrigued me. The Last Knight is truly a sight to behold, plus it's a great reminder that even great leaders can be easily manipulated by who they think they can trust, but at the same time even those great leaders who can be talked into doing things they never intended to do can be brought back to their true selves by the ones who are their real family. If it wasn't for Bumblebee we would've lost Optimus Prime forever, I'm so incredibly proud, now that is what a true friend looks like. If you haven't seen this movie yet than you are missing out on something truly amazing and beyond surprising, Earth is their home now and I wouldn't want it any other way, not for Bumblebee, not for Hound, not for Drift, not for Crosshairs, not for Grimlock, not for any single one of them, especially not even for Optimus Prime. WELCOME HOME AUTOBOTS!!! WELCOME HOME!!!!!</p>

<h3>Mission: Impossible â€“ Dead Reckoning Part One</h3>
<p>"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One" is an action-packed blockbuster that delivers on all fronts. With heart-stopping stunts, a compelling story, and a talented ensemble cast, this latest instalment in the long-running franchise is a testament to the enduring quality and excitement that the series consistently offers.</p>
